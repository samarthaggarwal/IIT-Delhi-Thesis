\noindent I wish to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisors, Prof. Mausam and Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti for their constant encouragement throughout this project, for their patience, motivation, enthusiasm and immense knowledge. They consistently allowed me to frame my own work, but steered me in the right direction whenever I needed it. I could not have imagined better advisors and mentors for my research.

\noindent I would also like to thank Keshav Kolluru for being an excellent collaborator. He brought structure to both my research and thought process allowing me to grow into this field of study. I am also obliged to Vipul Rathore for his help on a short notice during paper submissions.

\noindent I would pay my special regards to Yatin Nandwani, Prachi Jain, Lovish Madaan and Sushant Rathi for their insightful discussions, advices and quick work-arounds that proved to be very helpful.

\noindent I thank IIT Delhi HPC Facility for compute resources.

\noindent Lastly, I would like to dedicate this work to my beloved parents and my brother Yatharth for their love and constant support throughout my life.
